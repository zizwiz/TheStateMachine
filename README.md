# TheStateMachine
A small app to demonstrate how to implement a state machine in c# Winforms. This example is of a table lamp. You can plug it into the power, switch it on, switch it off and unplug. 

I needed to implement a state machine and did not know how so after reading lots of articles I drew bits from each (thanks to those who wrote about this topic) and made a simple example. As this is a simple example there are not many catches and checks. You will need to add them to make it more robust.
